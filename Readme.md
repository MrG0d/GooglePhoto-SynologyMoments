This script restores the file creation dates from the file name or from the JSON file that generates Google Takeout. 
This is necessary for further manual transfer (Drag and Drop) files to Synology Moments for save the timeline. 
Also, this script hides photos from Catalog with Media for the year (Photos from 2021), which are in other albums

1. Extract Google Takeout archive to <project_dir>/google_photo
2. Run `run.py`
